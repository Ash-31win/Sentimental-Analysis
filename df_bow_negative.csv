"These truffles are not as great as they are made up to be. I thought for the price they would have a greater taste, but they didn't have much taste at all. They are not worth the price, but had to find out for myself. I will not be buying truffles again, and I'm not going to spend over $10 for a fresh one.",0,0
"I purchased this because I read that it was a natural cure for hives..Um, how about NOT.  It did nothing for my hives and it tastes awful.  Luckily, a co-worker of mine loves this stuff (reminds him of his grandmother) and I gave it to him.  Yucky, yucky stuff.",0,0
"Besides being smaller than runts, they look the same and have the same consistency.  Unfortunately, they taste nothing like banana runts...nor do they even taste good.  Yucky stuff.  Trying to return with vendor.",0,0
"As a hot chocolate lover, I was verrrrry disappointed when I tried this product. I first had the peppermint (disgusting) and then tried the dark chocolate (a little better). The problem is that you can REALLY taste the artifical sweetener. I am a diet soda drinker, so I don't have a problem with artifical sweetener. It's just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste. I definitely will NOT buy again.... I would not recommend these to anyone.",0,0
"they decided to ship both my order in ONE HUGE box of 24 cans instead of 12 green beans in one box, 12 corn in another and i was barely able to get this inside my house.  then every single can of green beans was dented and 3 cans of corn were dented",0,0

"We've been feeding this food to our wheaten terrier for a year, with happy results - until last Tuesday, when my latest subscribe-and-save bag was opened: my dog started throwing up during the night after eating from this new bag. On the first night, I figured she'd eaten something bad off the street. On the second night, I figured it was the lingering effects of eating something bad off the street. On the third night, I started looking for other causes for the nighttime retching, and I realized that the vomiting had started on the same day as we'd started the new bag. I stopped feeding the dog the Newman's Own and the vomiting stopped for 2 nights. Last night, I fed her the food again, and sure enough, she threw up in the night.<br /><br />I trusted and liked this food - and all things under the Newman's Own brand - but i'll never buy their products again. They clearly have a dangerous quality control problem.",0,0
"My kids love these fruit roll ups and I remember having them as a child so I was delighted when I saw I could buy a large box. However, when they came we were disappointed!  The were were very old and hard...  We only opened one and it broke into pieces. Because it's a food item, you can't return which I think is ridiculous...we couldn't even eat them! I order lots of stuff from Amazon and have had a great experience except for these fruit roll ups. Don't buy food from Amazon! (The only reason I gave it 1 star is because I had to click on something and they did arrive on time).",0,0
"I love caramel and was excited when this arrived. But I AM SO DISAPPOINTED. Hardly any flavor at all, of coffee or caramel",0,0
"There should be an option for a 0 star rating because that is what I would rate this item.<br />First, the sampling was to include 9 varieties but included only 7.  It appears that the two flavors out of stock were not substituted with two other flavors but instead a few more of the remaining flavors were tossed in the box. I had expected that when a limited edition coffee flavor such as Island Coconut was out of stock, it would be replaced with a different limited edition coffee flavor.  Same thing for the Half and Half Lemonade.<br />Second, the order was not balanced.  Of the 7 flavors I did receive, only 2 were coffees, the remaining 5 were teas.<br />The concept of a summer sampler set is a good one but the execution here was an epic fail.  The order is being returned today.",0,0
"The SALSA smelled delicious, as I think it probably was - but, unfortunately, the person, at AMAZON, that is a packer (there is probably several) had very little ""stuffing"" to work with, especially on the bottoms.  Therefore, the bottoms were broken on all three bottles. As I reached for my computer; I was told NO RETURNS (cause it's a food item).  I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag; and I found ""none"" on their NEW FACE LIFT.  THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUT...THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES!  LIKE: I BUY A LOT OF ""STUFF"" AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES.  NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGS<br />ESPECIALLY SALSA - IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT.  NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE CARRIER (FED EX) IS CAREFUL, IT'S GOING TO BREAK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE.  ESPECIALLY IN AN ALL GLASS CONTAINER!  BARBARA L. S.",0,0
"The current product, ""Certified Organic Raw Cacao Powder from Ecuador, sold by SAAQIN"", is of terrible quality. Somehow, reviews for a similar item, produced by ""Alive and Aware"", were associated with this product. The cocoa I received when ordering through this page is made by ""Organic Herbal Essence"". Alive and Aware is delicious; Organic Herbal Essence is not. Another warning: After receiving the 5lb bag of Organic Herbal Essence and hating it, I ordered ""Alive and Aware Certified Organic Raw Cacao Powder from Ecuador - 2 Pounds"", shipped by Halaleveryday. I thought for sure I'd get Alive and Aware, given it's in the product title, but Halaleveryday actually shipped me ""Organic Herbal Essence"". Grr.",0,0
"This product makes me want to buy a Miracle Fruit tree so I can have these awesome berries all the time.<br /><br />The biggest changes my husband and I noticed were in eating fruits & other berries. Store-bought strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, oranges, and green apples tasted like they were just picked off the plant/bush/tree at the height of ripeness. It was like being a kid again and biting into my first :)<br /><br />I didn't notice any change at all with anything bitter. Beers and coffees and teas tasted about the same. Spicy things like hot sauce tasted kind of gross. Savory things like noodles and meat got a slight hint of sweetness, but nothing THAT noticeable. Sweet things like candy and cake were made to be way too sweet to be palatable.<br /><br />Definitely make sure you get the tablet to slide all over your tongue, and don't chew -- leave it on your tongue until it dissolves.<br /><br />If you're a fan of sweet, succulent fruit, but can't get fresh produce from farmer's markets, do yourself a favor and try these. It's worth the price for the fun, at the very least :)",1,0
I thought the Grove hot chocolate is to sweet. It also has an off taste. I would not recommend this to anybody,0,0
I thought the whole figs would be softer for spreading but they are not. You have figs laying in a very sweet syrup. I've only tried it on toast one time and it was way to sweet to eat. The figs just lay on top unspreadable. I would not buy again. Save your money.,0,0
"I used to like this product until I learned that it is made in China!<br /><br />How many more horror stories do we need to hear about such atrocities as lead in baby toys made in China, contaminated baby formula made in China, contaminated tooth paste made in China, and poisoned pet food before we learn that -- if it comes from China-- it should not go in your mouth, your baby's mouth, or your pet's mouth??!!!",0,0

"For those of you who, like me, had to order the Kettle Spicy Thai chips from Amazon because they are so hard to find locally, you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed.

"Oh my gosh.  I bought this tea and drank my first cup in the late afternoon.  By evening I was having the worst stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I belatedly looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves.  During internet research I discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products.  Also the following admonition - don't take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels.<br /><br />Side effects can include:<br />*diarrhea<br />*intestinal cramps or gripping pains<br />*rash<br />*severe weight loss<br /><br />Senna should not be used by persons with Crone's disease, Diverticular disease and other similar diseases.<br /><br />Senna is not a daily or causal supplement and excessive use can cause liver damage.<br /><br />I wanted to die my insides hurt so bad.  Any weight loss you may accomplish with this tea may not be worth the pain.  Be aware before you use.  I threw my remaining 29 tea bags away!",0,0

"Coffee is a very subjective thing.  Some people like coffee that borders on tea, others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous Battlestar Galactica pilot serves.  For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by ""that other chain"" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.  For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.<br /><br />With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn't seem Extra Bold.  Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribu's....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.<br /><br />So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef's Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.  Cream and Sweetener don't correct for this, and thus I'm a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark.<br /><br />I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you.  I like the character of the Colombian Chef's Reserve, but it is not as strong, and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards.  I don't believe you can get a bad cup of coffee in the Wolfgang Puck line however.  Can't say the same for some other K-cup brands.",0,0

Many people are buying this food believing it is safer because it is made in New Zealand. It is now made in the US by Performance Pet Products. I have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of 2007 and prior to the change it was excellent food and I was thrilled with it. Since ZiwiPeak has been switched to canning in the US it has been a nightmare. Several times in the last year I have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour. I had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools. Also recently I have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue. I've contacted the US distributor twice but they have never replied. A batch I got this month with an expiry date of 2014 has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy.,0,0
Good thirst quencher. Milky and thicker then I expected. Not what I would call a pineapple flavor but one can get the idea it is pineapple.,1,0
"If your newborn cries inconsolably, you should try a lactose-free formula right away even though they're so expensive. However, the ingredients may not look so good.  It's important to shop around if you're going to use a lactose-free formula. Lactose-free formulas always are the most expensive and this one is loaded with processed corn syrup solids.<br /><br />From Wikipedia: ""Baby colic (also known as infant colic, three-month colic, infantile colic and colic) is a condition in which an otherwise healthy baby cries or screams frequently and for extended periods without any discernible reason."" You'll know it if it happens to your baby, and it's awful to not be able to do anything to immediately relieve your baby.  It contains DHA, ARA and iron, but all baby formulas do because it is required by law.<br /><br />Lactose-free formula is expensive is because it goes through a very specialized and difficult manufacturing process, I'm told by the company's public relations representative.  So much food in the U.S. is prepared with corn syrup solids, so that shouldn't be a worry, I'm told.  Ok, but I notice the obesity rate is high.",0,0
"I ordered these lollipops for a friends Wizard of Oz themed shower. The arrived packaged well but I noticed the box said they're from ""Oriental Trading Company"".  If I wanted a cheap product that I knew was low quality and from China then I would have bought them directly from their site at $7 for 38 of them!!! However, from the picture these looked well made. The picture is very deceiving and so is the description. They show 16 same-colored lollipops...mine came in a variety of colors. They also gave dimentions that the lollipops were 6""x2"". I noticed they looked a bit small and when I measured they didn't even come to 5"" long, not any of them...even though they're all differnet lengths.  This was very disappointing since I planned to stand them up in a vase of lemon drops. Overall, I'm very disappointed in this product and the seller for not being honest about the product they're providing to consumers.",0,0
"The first time I tried this product to make pancakes, I thought it was terrible.  I made it according to the directions and used the ""right"" measuring cups for liquid and dry ingredients, but found that the batter came out thin and the texture was gummy.  Then, one day when I was visiting my mother, she decided to make pancakes, and since I am GF, she had bought this mix for me (not knowing I had already hated it).  I saw that she measured the ingredients ""incorrectly"" as she used the same measuring cup (generally used to measure liquids) for both the dry and the liquid ingredients.  She also used a whisk to mix the ingredients.  Amazingly enough, the pancakes came out fluffy, and I really liked it.  In fact, it is my favorite gluten free pancake mix so far.  Having said that, both my husband and I are of the opinion that this product still has a bit of the gritty texture that is present in many gf products.  However, it is the best pancake mix that I have found so far.",1,0
"Can't say anything bad about Sugar in the Raw.  I like it better than the other ""natural"" sugars. Better consistency and - I know it doesn't matter - but better color. Unfortunately, one of the ""natural"" paper bags got torn a bit in the box.  It didn't look like the box was damaged so I can't tell how it happened, but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when I opened it.  Not sure what the solution is and I'd order it again, but if it happens again, I'd switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag.",1,0
"The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed ""ginger with attitude"" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.  They might want to get rid of  ""Great Taste Naturally"" from their bags as I don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural.<br /><br />Great job Kettle!  Way to ruin a great thing!",0,0
"Recently purchased a case of Mori-Nu from Amazon ... I'd had this tofu before and the product I got from Amazon is fine. Though, a word of caution - my case only has about 4 1/2 months to go on its ""best by"" date. The date on the box represents one year from manufacture, so this product had been sitting around a while. Not a huge problem but I'll be looking for silken-tofu recipes now (vegan ice cream!), to use this up, rather than just having silken tofu on hand for a while, as I'd hoped.",1,0
"In proportion this drink is about equal to a regular soda in calories and sugar content, but I would prefer a regular soda than this stuff. There is a slight citrus taste, but mainly from acidity and a horrible after taste of metal and sickly sweetness that lingers for several minutes after wards.<br /><br />Soda water with natural juice should be a refreshing, pleasant, and nice refreshment, but none of these traits are in this drink.<br /><br />I would be embarrassed to serve this beverage to anyone I liked for any occasion, but would consider giving it to people I really didn't care for to see their reaction.<br /><br />Avoid this one. Orange Crush or a different orange soda diluted with soda water would taste far better or soda water and regular orange juice would also be a treat that puts this nasty stuff to shame.",0,0
"When I saw some of the Earth's Best jars offered as a Gold Box deal, I remembered that I needed to offer a caveat to other parents.<br />  My children have previously enjoyed many Earth's Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs. When they arrived, one of the 12-packs seemed ok, but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.<br />  I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.<br />  I don't know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too, because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too?<br />For more durable items, I still order from Amazon, but I canceled my subscription of the Earth's Best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where I can check them first.",0,0
"White bread is not my thing, so that's probably why I don't like this one.  I like herby white breads and really full-bodied white breads, but otherwise I always choose whole grains.  This one is not full-bodied and has no particular flavor.  Not interesting at all to me.",0,0

The molasses isn't quite as tasty as some I've had, but it has about 5 times more iron, so I'm ok with it.  I don't think anyone would buy molasses online if they just wanted a tasty food, so I guess it's a winner.",1,0
"This is a very good tasting carbonated juice drink that makes a great alternative to soda.  There is not an overload of carbonation.  Just enough to make it taste more like orange soda.<br /><br />It's made with 100% juice (more apple and grape than orange, surprisingly), it has 100% RDA Vitamin C, it's all natural with no sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, and it's gluten free.<br /><br />The flavor of the drink I tested was called orange tangerine, and it was an 8.3 fl. oz. can, with 140 calories and 34 grams of sugar.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that I really cannot picture myself paying for it.  It's rather expensive in comparison to the orange juice I buy at the grocery store, and if I want an alternative to regular soda I would go with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTIR6C"">Blue Sky Jamaican Ginger Ale, 12-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a>.

"Kettle brand chips are very crunchy.  I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the ""soft"" end of the ""soft/crunchy"" spectrum.  Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest, but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy.  If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth (dentures) you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand.  Otherwise, you'll love these chips.  The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are super TANGY.  I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time.  I am dissapointed with all other Salt & Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and/or the vinegar taste whimpy and/or chemically.

"I bought this mainly because another review (can't remember if it was on Amazon or another site) said it was better than Morningstar Farms crumbles and because it is GMO free. Now, I've been a vegetarian since I was thirteen (and that was decades ago), but I am the sort that DOES want fake meat resembling meat. I've little interest in a mushroom-quinoa burger; I want a meaty-yet-vegetarian burger with mushroom quinoa on the side. Also, I'm a professional chef, so I'm very picky about the foods I eat.<br /><br />I'm saying this because I think it is important to know what the reviewer likes to eat when you base your purchase on a review.<br /><br />Tonight, I used the Harmony Valley hamburger mix in lasagna alla bolognese. I also did the same recipe with the MF crumbles to compare. Two things I was curious about:<br /><br />1) flavor: they're *kind of* about the same, especially considering I was adding a browned mirepoix, marmite, and veg Worcestershire ... I guess I should fry up a patty of just the HV mix, but I did eat a raw spoonful and it was okay, but blander than MF<br /><br />2) texture: MF wins. It just does (sorry, MF haters). It has larger pieces with a more meat-like texture. Plus, even after absorbing water in the fridge and then simmering on the stove, the HV was too wet.<br /><br />Now, the reviewer who also liked it better than MF also said something about it holding together on its own and that MF doesn't. Well, that's true. This was thick and stuck to itself, much more like the texture of ground meat - if you were to puree it. I use MF often in meatballs, and it holds together when bound with eggs and cheese. I guess that's the difference; I don't just want to thaw or add water and *poof* have dinner. I expect to cook with an ingredient, the same as I would with real beef.<br /><br />So I wasn't bowled over in those ways, but I liked it. HV hamburger mix is good and I'm sure it will be useful, which is also a plus - no worry about not having bought a bag of frozen crumbles, you've got a half dozen packets at home. I have a tiny little freezer for someone who cooks for a living, so it is always an issue for me to be able to keep ingredients at home. And although I've seen some reviews complaining about the 15-20 wait for the HV mix to absorb water in the fridge ... really? Those people can't wait half an hour for a burger? If you want an instant veggie burger that can be microwaved in the time it takes you to grab the ketchup, buy a frozen burger. I think this mix will be good in better handmade veggie burgers and I look forward to trying!<br /><br />Addendum:<br /><br />After eating the lasagna made with the HV mix, both my husband and I experienced horrible stomach bloating and pain. I'm apparently a glutton for punishment, though, because I decided to give it another try and made meatballs with it yesterday. Not only did they not turn out as good as my usual ones (made with MF crumbles and Lightlife sausage), they had a sort of rubbery texture that I really did not care for. But, blander and texture I can overlook, except AGAIN, the product gave us both the same horrible stomach bloating pains and gas. Ugh!",0,0
"I love the other Nana's cookie bars and cookies, so I thought I'd give these a try even though they are ""No Gluten"" and made with rice flour instead of wheat flour.

They don't taste bad, which is a plus, but I won't be buying these again.",0,0
"-- If you buy this from Amazon, you'll be disappointed at the shipping.  My box of 12 came in one cardboard box, with the 12 container-boxes loosely in a plastic bag.  One was smashed, so leaking into the bag, two were dented, and one was coming open from the bottom due to the puddle of leaking water in the bag. I opened the bag, and it smelled awful from the rancid, leaking water. If Amazon wants to continue selling the 12-pack-33oz, it needs to package the shipping better. [NOTE, however, I was able to Live-Chat with Amazon and get a refund, even though the item is a ""non-returnable grocery item"".]<br />-- AND, review of the drink:  The drink itself is SUPERIOR to the taste of Vita-Coca(""good"") or Zico(too sweet), so as a drink, the O.N.E, really IS like drinking from a real coconut out in the tropics.  I am going back to the individual single-serve containers of O.N.E., shipped from Amazon.<br />-- AND, In a second comparison, the multi-pack of Vita-Coca-33oz comes SUPERBLY packaged in the shipping box from Amazon (as EACH 33oz container is invidually protected in a cardboard sleeve).<br />-- Hope that helps (and, Thank you Amazon for letting me have a refund on the damaged box, but it will be more helpful if you can protect the boxes better for shipping it to us).",0,0

"On a trip to Italy, muesli is what all the hotels had for breakfast as their cold cereal and I loved it.  Imagine how excited I was when I saw that Kellog's sold this product.  What did I learn?: despite the similar name, this cereal is quite unlike European-style muesli.  While the overall mix of grains and fruits is similar, this cereal is mostly a flake cereal, while a true muesli has no cereal flakes at all.<br /><br />""Real"" muesli is made of rolled (not flaked) grains; this has pluses and minuses.  On the plus side, milk does not turn European mueslis to mush in a couple of minutes like it does flake cereals.  On the minus side, European mueslis have to be soaked in milk or yogurt for about ten minutes or so (i.e. while you are in the shower, or while the coffee is brewing) or the cereal will be a bit on the chewy side.  For those that are concerned about eating processed foods, rolled grains have been processed less than flaked ones.  (Rolled grains are lightly steamed and then rolled and lightly toasted; flaked grains are fully steam-cooked until they are mush, pressed into flakes, fully baked and then usually sprayed with sugar to extend ""time-to-mushiness."")  And certainly only the Kellog's product contains HFCS.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to try one of the many other mueslis from Amazon (or better yet, single boxes from a local health-foods store if you have one) and see what you prefer.  I eat the Bob's Red Mill product available on Amazon (and one of my local grocery chains) instead of this, and am much more satisfied.  I haven't tried Familia (but I'm not crazy about the idea of the ""fruit flakes""), and the Dorset products are too fruit and nut heavy for me.  The other products are a hair more expensive than the Kellog's, but I'm willing to plunk down an extra dime or so per breakfast for a far superior product.<br /><br />I'm surprised Quaker doesn't sell a muesli product...  Given that they have to be the largest producer of rolled grains in the U.S., you'd think it would be a natural fit for them.",0,0
"I read all the positive reviews and thought I'd give it try. First of all it tasted stale.  Secondly I had to use 5 spoonfuls just to get any taste and then it didn't taste like the chocolate.

For my part I won't be ordering this again.  UPDATE: I bought the Milk chocolate at the same time and decided to try that.  It was delicious.

"I was offered the opportunity to taste this product because of Vine. I would not normally purchase this type of product, so my review and opinion will be biased in that regard.<br /><br />I'm not a big soda drinker, I'd just rather drink water or coffee.

This 8oz can of Switch has 140 calories and 34grams of sugar. And this is healthy? 4 ounces less is size, same caloric content and more sugar per ounce that Classic Coke. OK, so it's not ""added"" sugar, but still, that's a lot of sugar. 100% Orange juice, 8 oz, has 120 calories and 28 grams of sugar.<br /><br />The can says it is ""Orange Tangerine"" but in fact the contents are #1: Water #2: Concentrates of Apple, Grape, Tangerine, Orange, and Acerola juices.

It was for me, sickly sweet and left a sugary aftertaste in my mouth. Not only that, but the taste was just nasty. It didn't taste at all like orange or tangerine to me. It just tasted terribly sweet with an undefined cirtus something taste. The carbonation did not add anything positive to the experience. Neither of us finished drinking our 4oz portion.

"Although some may like this drink, it will not be a repeat buy for me.  140 calories for an 8+ oz serving is too much when that amount of orange juice is 115.  Actually this drink isn't 100% orange/tangerine juice, but a mix of juices.  Secondly, if this were unaltered juice, seems you wouldn't have to add ascorbic acid to get 100% of your daily Vitamin C since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over 150%. Perhaps the processing requires it. But, alas, the biggest issue for me was taste.  It tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells.<br /><br />On the good side, the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that.  There is no sugar added and the non-traditional taste is not overly sweet.  The taste may appeal to some, but I'm not a fan.",0,0

People don't realize that you should use it on fruits and things with acidity. It is supposed to make them sweeter. Although it did make one of my cookies sweeter it wasn't nearly as dramatic as when I ate a lime. It tasted like lime-ade.

"Nature's Recipe is now a division of that mega company Del Monte Foods.<br /><br />The Test<br /><br />The neat thing about this food is that it really does look like the photograph on the bag. It consists of smallish kibble with pieces of dried carrots and peas mixed in. When the bag was first opened the girls ate small amounts of Farm Selects unmixed and readily took to it. Since then they've been eating it mixed with their Blue food.<br /><br />I thought Evie and Piper might fuss with the dried vegetables in there, but they don't specifically target the vegetables to leave behind.<br /><br />The quality of this food is obvious to one who reads the ingredient list. Only one ingredient, that animal digest, makes me cringe a little. The girls don't mind it a bit. For goodness alone I can heartily recommend this natural food, but the price on it is relatively high. Rachel Ray's dry dog food, for example, is about half the price of Farm Stands Selects, and Buffalo Blue is about the same price. For a household like ours with three dogs, the Farm Stands Selects is too pricey  to feed the girls exclusively. We'd feel obliged to mix another good, but less expensive food with it. For those with one pet and for whom money is not an issue, I say you can't go wrong with Farm Selects.",1,0

I steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them.  An even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health.  When I purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description, now it is.  I think that AMAZON as a regular practice should require all food products/company's to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site.  WHY WAIT UNTIL THE CUSTOMER PURCHASE IT TO FIND OUT???!!!  I don't think this is a customer friendly practice!!!!<br /><br />Not a good buy IMO.  I found my Konriko at another site and will be purchasing it from there; unless AMAZON brings it back at a 12 count offer; otherwise to buy one at $8 and $4.99 s/h is just way over priced and highway robbery!!!!",0,0
"These cups are artifically sweetened with sucralose - I didn't realize until I tried one, and ended up with a little bit of a headache, which made me check the ingredient list - it isn't noted on the front of the box.  They definitely have an artificial taste, I would not buy them again.",0,0
The sinus buster tea had an interesting aroma when seeping; it's taste is acquired not offense at least to say more like burnt bark or really overheated coffee. I had no drainage of my sinuses while drinking one cup of the tea the next morning I could feel relief of pressure and pain. I would prefer this product over any inhaled sinus relief agent. As a plus all the ingredients of the tea are on the package in english nothing unknown.,1,0
"I have been using this protein powder for about a month. The first thing I noticed is that this brand mixes better than Optimum Nutrition egg protein, but still not like whey or even rice protein. The texture is not great by itself in my opinion- not awful but not great. I have been mixing Garden of Eating Super Seed with the powder before adding water and it mixes to a much better texture. I've also tried blending the two with ice to make a smoothy which turned out ok. For those of us who can't tolerate the whey or soy proteins, this particular brand is the best I've found.",1,0
"I am not an espresso snob. I may roast my own beans for drip coffee, but when I'm making espresso it's generally going in a bunch of milk and syrups.<br /><br />I purchased the Lavazza because I was out of the Alessi decaf I'd purchased at the store and the Lavazza was a good deal. For my purposes, this is completely adequate and does a fine job. At the same time I placed this order, I also ordered some Lavazza non-decaf espresso, which frankly doesn't seem to be as good as the Illy I've been using. For half the price, though, I can probably suffer through the decreased quality.<br /><br />If you're drinking it straight, probably not a good choice. If you're mixing it, it's more than adequate.",1,0
"One of my longtime favorite drinks is a half-and-half combination of club soda and fruit juice. Most fruit juices by themselves are a bit too sweet for me (even the ones without added sugar), and the addition of carbonation just makes the whole thing more agreeable to me. This drink does this for me, and amazingly, they do not add a boatload of sugar. Too many off-the-shelf beverages--even those claiming to be healthful--have way too much sugar (or worse, the cheap corn syrup sugar substitute). These guys give it none of that. It's both tasty and refreshing. This is a product I would actually buy.",1,0

"This was my first experience of a bad Darjeeling - before, I hadn't known there was such a thing. The first brew yielded a dark rust color tinged with olive-green. The bottom of the cup was invisible. The taste was sharp and astringent. Thinking I'd brewed too long or too strong, I set the first cup aside and tried again. And then again. A light brew of 3 minutes improved the clarity; however, nothing I have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that I associate with lesser teas. The wet leaves are the typical size, light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares.  The aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay - neither moldy nor spoiled, just old. In contrast, the Davidson's Keemun Conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious Keemun Conjou and nothing else.<br /><br />Given the price, I knew I was gamboling and consider this a lost bet. I have given the product two stars instead of one, because I haven't thrown it out (yet). I keep a supply of Lipton's bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of unemployment, and I don't really need more emergency tea. Perhaps it will work for iced tea.<br /><br />By no means am I an expert, but I do value tea, and so I hope this opinion helps other buyers who are trying to decide between two Darjeelings. Davidson's ships quickly with value pricing, and so I am not giving up on the merchant. Just on this particular Darjeeling.",0,0
"If it were possible to give this product zero stars, I would have done so.  I am a huge fan of Twinings teas, and was very excited to try this new blend.  After arriving home from the grocery, I immediately started the kettle to enjoy a cup while prepping dinner.  Between sorting, washing, and chopping items, the hot water was added to the bag to steep.  Preparation continued, until a distinctly off odor hit me.  I thought one of my ingredients must be rancid!  I hunted around for almost four minutes before I realized it was the tea.  Even after cleaning up, and airing out the kitchen, my roommate later came in and asked about the smell.  Save your money to purchase ANY other Twinings product.",0,0

"I must be the odd man out here...but this powdered goat milk is horrible!  My 18 month old son is allergic to dairy and soy, hence the reason for goat milk.  We were going on vacation for two weeks, and I was afraid there would not be any source of goat milk at that destination. Being he drinks almost a quart a day of regular liquid goat milk I purchase from Trader Joe's, I figured I would go for the gusto and buy a two weeks supply for him. It smelled horrible and more importantly tasted horrible! Words cannot even describe how disgusting this stuff was.  My poor son almost threw up from tasting it which prompted me to smell it.  It smelled so bad, I couldn't even taste it myself.  Maybe we're just used to the regular brand he drinks?  My only advice, try a small amount first.  It is not returnable!!!",0,0

"I opened the can and immediately became concerned when I saw what looked like dried white crust, rather than fluffy frosting.  The package recommended stirring before use, so I gave that a try and under the crust was an indescribable gelatinous goo.  The best I can equate it to is a white version of the blue goop the mother serves for dinner in ""Better of Dead"" (no raisins in it though!).<br />I tried to stir it together and the end result was gelatinous goo with white crusties in it.  When lifting the knife to spread it long strings on goo trailed from my knife.<br />I opted for making my own frosting instead - very easy!  A little Sprectrum palm shortening, a lot of powdered sugar, a tiny splash of vanilla, a tiny bit of salt, and rice milk as needed for consistency, beat for 5 minutes, and I had the fluffy 'butter' cream frosting I thought I'd get from Cherrybrook.<br /><br />I wonder if our can was overheated in the store (whole foods) or something...<br />I've read positive reviews of their frosting mix, so maybe I'll try that next time.",0,0

"I purchased this product because of its name, ""Rumford NATURALS Corn Starch"" (the word ""Naturals"" appears large and clear on the pictured product label). Also, the Amazon description said it was made from ""Non-Genetically Modified Corn"". The label on the product that I ACTUALLY received does NOT say Rumford NATURALS, but it is still MADE WITH Non-Genetically Modified Corn. I say ""made with"" because this product now contains more than ONE ingredient. Its ingredients are: Cornstarch, Calcium Sulfate*, and ONE of the suggested servings (1 Tblsp) contains 15% of the ""Daily Value"" of CALCIUM. That makes this product potentially a good source for dietary calcium supplementation. ON THE OTHER HAND, for persons who must restrict their calcium intake (example, some persons with kidney stones), it can pose a potential problem, even danger. Amazon provides themselves with a nice ""out"" for this.

We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product.""

AND, if you use too much of this product (basically the same amount as I had previous used of pure CORN STARCH), the very stiff sediment in the bottom of the cooking container (I make pudding in Pyrex in a microwave and usually stir it only every 30 seconds) will remind you of damp plaster!",0,0

This water is expensive - cheap for online, but costly if you are a Walmart or Target shopper. However, I highly recommend you try this, if you want tasteless water. You see, when water is mineral enhanced, and its swirling around through the various protrusions and undulations the road provides in the summer heat, the water tends to build a certain taste, which some like, and others don't.

"I have a One:One Coffee Pod machine and have ordered pods online before.  These looked good and sounded like high quality coffee- albeit a little pricey for 12 pods.  This was the worst cup of coffee I have ever tasted!  It left a bitter taste in my mouth that lingered for hours.  Yuck!  Don't be fooled by the fancy name and packaging. It tastes like rocket fuel.  Fortunately, Amazon refunded my money when I explained how bad it was. Throwing the whole box away!",0,0
"This coffee smells really bad - there is definitely no ""delicious"" smell as it brews or as you take sips from your mug.  It tastes just as awful too.  The first couple sips that I had, with my nose closed so I couldn't smell it, wasn't too bad but the more sips I took the more disgusting it was.  It is absolutely stomach turning (to me at least) and unfortunately I will never drink the whole bag. It tastes like a weak, poorly brewed, cheap cup of coffee (though not cheap!).  The only positive note is that it did not irritate my bladder - just irritated my nose and taste buds.",0,0
"Since I am willing to try alot of new things. I thought that I would buy this product.. And since I do like hot cocoa, I bought 2 boxes.. WORST thing I could have done..

"I first tasted Sassafras tea in a local restaurant and really liked it.  So I started looking in grocery stores and online for it in a teabag form.  After several weeks of investigation I called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea.  I was told is was Pappy's Sassafras Concentrate.  I looked online and found it at Amazon.com.  As I was ordering it I also saw the Sassafras Teabags.  I thought I'd order a box to try.  I was very dissapointed.  It didn't taste like the flat rootbeer I was expecting.  It was more like black licorice, which I hate, with a very mild rootbeer undertone.  It also didn't have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras root.<br /><br />I've never had real Sassafras tea made with the root so I don't know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not.

"...or the good reviewers' taste buds are weak.  This is some disappointingly<br />weak coffee.

"If Keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular K-Cup, Keurig would be out of business. Wolfgang Puck - French Roast Melange Francais is inexcusably terrible coffee.

"I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea.

"For those looking for a more exotic tea drinking experience and who like white Jasmine tea, Numi's Flower Jewel is worth a look. About the size of a gum-ball, these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower. They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this tea.<br /><br />Decorative does not mean tasteless. As a white tea, the flavor is mild, but rich and soothing. The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea. I have had stronger jasmine teas, but this one is quite balanced and tasty. I used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade. The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and don't get bitter if seeped for long periods.<br /><br />I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels. Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart, though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact. Some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf. Better packaging might solve this.<br /><br />If you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells, or are entertaining and want a conversation piece, then Numi Tea Flower Jewel should be on your short list.",1,0

This is not the time for corporations who want to succeed and grow to cheat consumers! Is this a growing trend? I find it so.",0,0
"This was very pricey for what is essentially a small bag of hard crumbs.<br />Maybe my dog is just spoiled, but she treats these like third class treats- it is definitely on the bottom of the doggie treat hierarchy.  More often than not, she will simply walk away from these.  Glad other people like them, but I will not be buying them again.",0,0
"When I opened the package, I only found 11 packets of the Honey Stingers. There should have been 12. I counted and re-counted 4 times to be sure. The packets were in a thin cardboard display box, wrapped in a sealed plastic bag, and shipped in a sturdy cardboard box. I don't really want to go through the hassle of returning the item, so I guess I'm out a pack.  It'd be nice if amazon shipped me one more packet! ;-)",1,0
"Having liked the various types of Ghirardelli chocolate and premium hot cocoa's I decided to try some Ghirardelli Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix, Chocolate Mocha. After trying several cups of this I started to wonder what happened to the Ghirardelli Chocolate as myself I thought it was overpowered with the coffee taste. Not my cup of hot cocoa!!",0,0
"I bought two bags of these, thinking it was the same product that I used to buy in different packaging (light blue, with a see-through dog shape against a grass green background). Unfortunately, it was completely not the same thing! These treats were actually like jerky-- tough and brittle. I give my dog soft treats because he doesn't chew the damn things, and he choked on these horrible things; I had to toss them out.<br /><br />Note that the ""Zuke's Jerky Naturals"" with the other packaging (http://www.amazon.com/Zukes-Jerky-Naturals-Beef/dp/B00008DFPY) have always been moist and soft, and I've never had a problem with those. I suspect that this batch was not new packaging, as I had thought, but very old packaging; these may be the same treats I usually feed my dog, just having sat on a shelf for years. In any case, these were COMPLETELY different treats, and not safe to feed my dog.",0,0
"I don't eat beef jerky, and I wanted to buy some for a Christmas gift.  I read all of the reviews at Amazon.com and decided that Jack Links would be the best purchase.  It came nicely packaged, but there is liquid in the packaging - a lot of it.  If you turn the packaging upside down, the movement of the liquid is obvious.  So now I have to pay to return soupy beef jerky and buy a different type.<br /><br />Three days since my original review.  Amazon cannot accept returns of food items, so it kindly replaced the beef jerky.  The replacement also has liquid in it.  It's not fat, but a liquid as described above.  This time, I'm asking for a refund.",0,0
"Maybe the miracle fruit does not work for everyone. It had very little effect when I used it. I started with a clear pallet, let the pill dissolve on my tongue etc. Then I tried the classic first, a lime. I noticed, barely, that it was not quite as pucker inducing as it may have been without the mberry but just slightly. And it did not add any ""sweet"". It just inhibited a hint of sour. Other foods like vinegar, vinegar chips, Guinness, strawberries, cheese, etc. Many recommended fruits and foods have very little impact. And after just a few minutes, I could notice any change.<br /><br />So, either, some people just don't have the same level of effect or much of the miracle berry effects are group dynamics and heightened suggestibility. Either way, they were a let down.",0,0
"I've been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years, usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas, where many Middle-Eastern stores carry loose Ahmad teas, usually at $5-7 for a pound box.  I've always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea, with enough aroma and taste, and beautiful reddish color, perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own, but a decent base for mixes.<br />This tea, however, is nothing of the sort. Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell, and the brewed tea is weak, flat and tasteless.  Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore. So, you get a lot of tea for the money, but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags, they are not that much worse.",0,0
We bought both brands to try and found this one with much less chocolate taste then Cafe Escapes dark chocolate.  It was also thinner in consistency. Won't buy again,0,0
