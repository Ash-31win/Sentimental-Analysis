"These truffles are not as great as they are made up to be. I thought for the price they would have a greater taste, but they didn't have much taste at all. They are not worth the price, but had to find out for myself. I will not be buying truffles again, and I'm not going to spend over $10 for a fresh one.",0,0
"Besides being smaller than runts, they look the same and have the same consistency.  Unfortunately, they taste nothing like banana runts...nor do they even taste good.  Yucky stuff.  Trying to return with vendor.",0,0
"they decided to ship both my order in ONE HUGE box of 24 cans instead of 12 green beans in one box, 12 corn in another and i was barely able to get this inside my house.  then every single can of green beans was dented and 3 cans of corn were dented",0,0
"i ordered this in the past and was extremely disappointed. they are unlike truffles that i know of. they were hard like a huge seed, had no truffle aroma. i threw all contents out. will never order them again",0,0
"My kids love these fruit roll ups and I remember having them as a child so I was delighted when I saw I could buy a large box. However, when they came we were disappointed!  The were were very old and hard...  We only opened one and it broke into pieces. Because it's a food item, you can't return which I think is ridiculous...we couldn't even eat them! I order lots of stuff from Amazon and have had a great experience except for these fruit roll ups. Don't buy food from Amazon! (The only reason I gave it 1 star is because I had to click on something and they did arrive on time).",0,0
"There should be an option for a 0 star rating because that is what I would rate this item.<br />First, the sampling was to include 9 varieties but included only 7.  It appears that the two flavors out of stock were not substituted with two other flavors but instead a few more of the remaining flavors were tossed in the box. I had expected that when a limited edition coffee flavor such as Island Coconut was out of stock, it would be replaced with a different limited edition coffee flavor.  Same thing for the Half and Half Lemonade.<br />Second, the order was not balanced.  Of the 7 flavors I did receive, only 2 were coffees, the remaining 5 were teas.<br />The concept of a summer sampler set is a good one but the execution here was an epic fail.  The order is being returned today.",0,0
I thought the Grove hot chocolate is to sweet. It also has an off taste. I would not recommend this to anybody,0,0

"I ordered these lollipops for a friends Wizard of Oz themed shower. The arrived packaged well but I noticed the box said they're from ""Oriental Trading Company"".  If I wanted a cheap product that I knew was low quality and from China then I would have bought them directly from their site at $7 for 38 of them!!! However, from the picture these looked well made. The picture is very deceiving and so is the description. They show 16 same-colored lollipops...mine came in a variety of colors. They also gave dimentions that the lollipops were 6""x2"". I noticed they looked a bit small and when I measured they didn't even come to 5"" long, not any of them...even though they're all differnet lengths.  This was very disappointing since I planned to stand them up in a vase of lemon drops. Overall, I'm very disappointed in this product and the seller for not being honest about the product they're providing to consumers.",0,0
"Can't say anything bad about Sugar in the Raw.  I like it better than the other ""natural"" sugars. Better consistency and - I know it doesn't matter - but better color. Unfortunately, one of the ""natural"" paper bags got torn a bit in the box.  It didn't look like the box was damaged so I can't tell how it happened, but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when I opened it.  Not sure what the solution is and I'd order it again, but if it happens again, I'd switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag.",1,0
"When I saw some of the Earth's Best jars offered as a Gold Box deal, I remembered that I needed to offer a caveat to other parents.<br />  My children have previously enjoyed many Earth's Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs. When they arrived, one of the 12-packs seemed ok, but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.<br />  I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.<br />  I don't know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too, because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too?<br />For more durable items, I still order from Amazon, but I canceled my subscription of the Earth's Best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where I can check them first.",0,0

Usually do not get the breakfast blends but it was on sale and decided at price would try it out. It was not as weak as some breakfast blends tend to be. Not bad.,1,0

"-- If you buy this from Amazon, you'll be disappointed at the shipping.  My box of 12 came in one cardboard box, with the 12 container-boxes loosely in a plastic bag.  One was smashed, so leaking into the bag, two were dented, and one was coming open from the bottom due to the puddle of leaking water in the bag. I opened the bag, and it smelled awful from the rancid, leaking water. If Amazon wants to continue selling the 12-pack-33oz, it needs to package the shipping better. [NOTE, however, I was able to Live-Chat with Amazon and get a refund, even though the item is a ""non-returnable grocery item"".]<br />-- AND, review of the drink:  The drink itself is SUPERIOR to the taste of Vita-Coca(""good"") or Zico(too sweet), so as a drink, the O.N.E, really IS like drinking from a real coconut out in the tropics.  I am going back to the individual single-serve containers of O.N.E., shipped from Amazon.<br />-- AND, In a second comparison, the multi-pack of Vita-Coca-33oz comes SUPERBLY packaged in the shipping box from Amazon (as EACH 33oz container is invidually protected in a cardboard sleeve).<br />-- Hope that helps (and, Thank you Amazon for letting me have a refund on the damaged box, but it will be more helpful if you can protect the boxes better for shipping it to us).",0,0

"I'm not a gourmet coffee critic, but this stuff is disappointing.  Based upon previous good reviews, I suspect that the coffee in the K-cups I received is not the same -- they may have changed the manufacturing.  The Wolfgang Puck Decaf I received is lifeless, watery, and tasteless.  There's no aroma when it's brewing in the Keurig.  Never again.",0,0
"This hot chocolate tastes like hot sugar water with a pinch of coco in it. Although, even the sugary taste is weak, and tainted by the flavor of the artificial sweetener sucralose. The consistency is watery and bland. This is when I made the 8oz cup as directed by the directions on the box.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product.",0,0
"The protein powder is ok, not to good as i expected. if you pour hot milk over it will will form substance like egg white, which is very bad in taste, not at all drinkable.",0,0
Only three jars came in a form edible to babies.  The rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water.  It also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixture.<br />Pretty disappointing and a waste of money.,0,0
"I have had Green Mountain coffee before, but had not tried the French Roast.  I am just realizing that there is a taste difference between different manufacturers, even with the same types of roasts.  The Green Mountain French Roast has the flavor I like and was expecting.  The price was reasonable and my order shipped quickly.  My only disappointment was in the shipping packaging.  I knew that I was ordering 2 boxes of K-cups but was surprised to see how big the shipping box was.  There was room for 3 boxes, with the extra space filled with bubble-wrap, which seems wasteful to me.  But on the whole, I am very happy with my coffee!",1,0
"I read all the positive reviews and thought I'd give it try. First of all it tasted stale.  Secondly I had to use 5 spoonfuls just to get any taste and then it didn't taste like the chocolate. It tasted more like Olvatine.  For the young people out there, Ovaltine was drink in the 50's, Which I didn't like any better. We all have different tastes.  For my part I won't be ordering this again.  UPDATE: I bought the Milk chocolate at the same time and decided to try that.  It was delicious.  I can't explain the difference but I'd recommend the Milk Chocolate just stay away from the one with the marshmallows.",0,0
"I was offered the opportunity to taste this product because of Vine. I would not normally purchase this type of product, so my review and opinion will be biased in that regard.<br /><br />I'm not a big soda drinker, I'd just rather drink water or coffee. I will occasionally drink a diet soft drink, usually Diet Pepsi or Diet Coke.<br /><br />Did you know that a single 12oz can of Coke Classic® has 140 calories and 39 grams of sugar? This 8oz can of Switch has 140 calories and 34grams of sugar. And this is healthy? 4 ounces less is size, same caloric content and more sugar per ounce that Classic Coke. OK, so it's not ""added"" sugar, but still, that's a lot of sugar. 100% Orange juice, 8 oz, has 120 calories and 28 grams of sugar.<br /><br />The can says it is ""Orange Tangerine"" but in fact the contents are #1: Water #2: Concentrates of Apple, Grape, Tangerine, Orange, and Acerola juices. Then they throw in some ""gum acacia"", ""natural flavors and colors"" and some ""ascorbic acid(vitamin C)"". And as a little surprise bonus, they have added ""soy"". Soy?<br /><br />I asked my wife to taste this product with me. I poured the drink into two glasses and we both took a sip. Her reaction was swift and strong... she hated it. I agreed with her. It was for me, sickly sweet and left a sugary aftertaste in my mouth. Not only that, but the taste was just nasty. It didn't taste at all like orange or tangerine to me. It just tasted terribly sweet with an undefined cirtus something taste. The carbonation did not add anything positive to the experience. Neither of us finished drinking our 4oz portion. It went down the sink.<br /><br />I would not purchase this product in the future and if I could have given it 0-stars, I would have. It's that bad.",0,0
"Although some may like this drink, it will not be a repeat buy for me.  140 calories for an 8+ oz serving is too much when that amount of orange juice is 115.  Actually this drink isn't 100% orange/tangerine juice, but a mix of juices.  Secondly, if this were unaltered juice, seems you wouldn't have to add ascorbic acid to get 100% of your daily Vitamin C since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over 150%. Perhaps the processing requires it. But, alas, the biggest issue for me was taste.  It tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells.<br /><br />On the good side, the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that.  There is no sugar added and the non-traditional taste is not overly sweet.  The taste may appeal to some, but I'm not a fan.",0,0
"This batch was horrible.  Since most regular coffee were out of stock, I tried this one.  It tastes and smells awful.  Do not buy this flavor.",0,0

I bought those chips after reading good reviews but I was very disappointed with the taste. It was nothing like what I expected (granted that I expected good old kettle cooked potato chips). I bought the 6-flavor variety pack and there were many flavors I did not care for. It was worth trying them but I am not going to purchase them again in the future.,0,0
"I have a big sweet tooth and thought I would really like this, but it was too sweet even for me. I even tried adding water, but that didn't help. I haven't tried any of the other flavors, so I can't comment on the brand in general, but I'll never try this flavor again.",0,0
"First, the product pictured is not what you get.<br /><br />What you really get is are tiny packets called ""sticks"" suitable for flavoring bottled water. The box doesn't even say what size bottle it is sized for.<br /><br />I'm not keeping it so I can't tell you how it tastes.",0,0
"I really, really dislike Sucralose.  I don't like the taste, the aftertaste, or the after effects.  I bought this based on it NOT saying it was ""diet"" or ""low calorie"".  The first ingredient is Sugar so it's only partially sweetened with Sucralose.  Sucralose is buried way down in the ingredients list but the taste is noticeable.<br /><br />Sure wish Amazon contained the full nutrition and ingredients labels from all food products.",0,0
"i've never written an amazon review before, but this product was so horrible i had to warn would be buyers; i can eat pretty much anything, but i had to empty out both bottles... it just tasted like colored sugar water (very thin), sickening sweet.. don't know if there was any onion flavoring.. the only reason i bought this is because i couldn't get ken's steakhouse vidalia onion dressing shipped in California.  So far, the worst product i have purchased on amazon.  Buyer beware, unless you like sugar water, then ""drink up""..blech.",0,0

"This coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong, but I have to say it almost ruined my months' old Keurig Personal Brewer. The coffee is ground so finely that when the K-Cups are punctured by the needles (top and bottom), it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles, going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty ""sludge"" in the bottom of each cup. I purchased a pack of 2 (48 K-Cups) and didn't even use one full pack. I do not recommend this brand or blend. It is a waste of money, which is something I couldn't really afford at this time. I sent a letter of complaint to the Wolfgang Puck company and, except for a ""cookie cutter"" letter acknowledging receipt of my comment, I have not received any further contact from them.",0,0
"This is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe... it's artificially flavored, and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it. My household hated it. Of course, that would be my problem if the description was accurate, but it's not. Amazon refunded my money and said someone would check the information on the product page.",0,0

"The packet of these seeds that I received must have been old because I don't believe even 10% of them grew. I tried some several times in soil and water and only got a few sprigs of grass. I garden regularly (I live in Florida) so it's not that I don't know how, and I even followed the instructions to the letter, but they did not grow.",0,0
"I had used this frequently on and off over the years and didn't realize that it is not sold in the US any longer.  In the past the instructions were in English on the packet but I don't recall what they were. Now it is entirely in German and no one I know speaks a word of the language. I don't have a scanner so one of the solutions suggested won't work.  Don't buy before realizing that if you don't speak German and have no one to translate you are in a pickle.. I have 10 packs now!  Another thing, all 10 packs expire in 6 months time, so don't buy in bulk unless you plan to eat a lot of sauerbraten.  Rated 1 only because I am unable to use the product and the product description does not mention either the language issue or the near term expiration date.",0,0
"THis product (which i am not allowed to return) has ingrediants of salt, spices, hydrolysed soy protein, that last item is the common industry con for adding msg to your food. Every soup on your grocers shelf contains msg, but, i digress. So, the third ingrediant is a form of MSG, further down the ingrediant list is proudly displayed ... Monosodium Gludamate, ...MSG. This does not add spice to your food, it stimulats your tongue into feeling that the food tastes good, when IT DOES NOT. MSG can make dogfood taste like hamburger. anyone who thinks this is making their food taste cajun may be serving ALPO.  Tones and Durkee (sp) do not contain MSG, I prefer Tones!<br /><br />I have 8 eight ounce cans of this stuff.. would anybody like to buy some hamburger from me?",0,0
The grains make this food really flakey. It just doesn't stick together and was falling off the spoon. A major mess really. It also doesn't have a zip lock top and I thought it did like many of the other pouch foods and took this with us out to dinner. I ended up putting the leftovers in a plastic baggie. My baby also was not a fan of this at all and she is not a picky eater. Even my dogs turned their nose up at it and I thought it tasted pretty nasty.,0,0
"I had to be taken to the ER in an ambulance earlier, the day before yesterday. I was having seizures, near-syncope (passing out, but still being somewhat conscious), couldn't breathe, and my blood pressure was at stroke level. I felt like and thought I was dying (or maybe already) dead for about 3 hours. It was painful and horrifying. I think I figured out what it was that caused my near-death experience. It was probably the energy-shot I took 20 minutes before then. I don't usually take something like that. Someone offered it to me, and I was so tired, I didn't even look at the bottle and took it. Please, don't use these!",0,0
Nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored. I'm still not sure what flavor it is. Some type of nut. I wrongly assumed that Jamaican coffee would be similar to the Blue Mountain coffee which Jamaica is known for! How silly of me to assume that! I hate flavored coffees so I was so disappointed to now own 2 boxes of such a horrible coffee. It only says flavored very small on the box so I didn't notice it before I opened it. Hopefully I can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee-flavored coffee for myself!,0,0
Warning: this is a STRONG flavor.<br /><br />I thought that this would be Blue Mountain-y... oh no. It is like... rum flavored or something. Yuk.,0,0
"I guess there is a reason that the ingredient section on this page doesn't mention that the first ingredient is trans fat (partially hydrogenated oil).  Had I know, I would not have purchased this.  Consumers need to vote with their dollars and avoid buying items where the manufacturer is using cheap and unhealthy ingredients.",0,0
"I bought this seasoning because Amazon stopped selling the 12 count Konriko cajun seasoning so this was the one they had in a 12 count.  I bought it thinking it would be similar to the Konriko, BOY WAS I WRONG!!!<br /><br />First of all like another reviewer said some of the ingredients are as follows:  hydrolyzed soy protein, and Partially hydrogenated cottonseed and soy bean oil.  I was completely stumped as to why these two ingredients were necessary in a spice blend mix.  Now I know why with the hydrolyzed soy protein; as the other reviewer stated it's a industry way of adding MSG.  Well why in the world do we need that and what's up with the HYDROGENATED SOY BEAN AND COTTONSEED OIL!!!!  BESIDE IT BEING BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH IT CAUSES THE PRODUCT TO CAKE AND CLUMP.  I steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them.  An even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health.  When I purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description, now it is.  I think that AMAZON as a regular practice should require all food products/company's to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site.  WHY WAIT UNTIL THE CUSTOMER PURCHASE IT TO FIND OUT???!!!  I don't think this is a customer friendly practice!!!!<br /><br />Not a good buy IMO.  I found my Konriko at another site and will be purchasing it from there; unless AMAZON brings it back at a 12 count offer; otherwise to buy one at $8 and $4.99 s/h is just way over priced and highway robbery!!!!",0,0
"These cups are artifically sweetened with sucralose - I didn't realize until I tried one, and ended up with a little bit of a headache, which made me check the ingredient list - it isn't noted on the front of the box.  They definitely have an artificial taste, I would not buy them again.",0,0

"I must be the odd man out here...but this powdered goat milk is horrible!  My 18 month old son is allergic to dairy and soy, hence the reason for goat milk.  We were going on vacation for two weeks, and I was afraid there would not be any source of goat milk at that destination. Being he drinks almost a quart a day of regular liquid goat milk I purchase from Trader Joe's, I figured I would go for the gusto and buy a two weeks supply for him. It smelled horrible and more importantly tasted horrible! Words cannot even describe how disgusting this stuff was.  My poor son almost threw up from tasting it which prompted me to smell it.  It smelled so bad, I couldn't even taste it myself.  Maybe we're just used to the regular brand he drinks?  My only advice, try a small amount first.  It is not returnable!!!",0,0

I've lived in Hawaii most<br />of my life and have shopped mostly in the local health food stores-so i have had<br />many many different batches of Basmati rice.  What Amazon has sent me is NOT<br />edible in my opinion.

"I purchased this product because of its name, ""Rumford NATURALS Corn Starch"" (the word ""Naturals"" appears large and clear on the pictured product label). Also, the Amazon description said it was made from ""Non-Genetically Modified Corn"". The label on the product that I ACTUALLY received does NOT say Rumford NATURALS, but it is still MADE WITH Non-Genetically Modified Corn. I say ""made with"" because this product now contains more than ONE ingredient. Its ingredients are: Cornstarch, Calcium Sulfate*, and ONE of the suggested servings (1 Tblsp) contains 15% of the ""Daily Value"" of CALCIUM. That makes this product potentially a good source for dietary calcium supplementation. ON THE OTHER HAND, for persons who must restrict their calcium intake (example, some persons with kidney stones), it can pose a potential problem, even danger. Amazon provides themselves with a nice ""out"" for this. They list the following: Legal Disclaimer: ""Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product."" BUT, IT IS NOT FAIR FOR AMAZON TO NOT AT LEAST LIST THE CORRECT INGREDIENTS AND PHOTO OF THE PACKAGE SO THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ORDER THE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO ""READ LABELS"" AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU HAVE PURCHASED.<br /><br />I WILL NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN:<br /> * because I don't need extra calcium<br /> * because I don't believe that the Calcium Sulfate was added out of interest in the consumer's health<br />  but to make the product cheaper to produce so it can be priced competitively with other brands<br />  and still be touted as having been made from/with Non-Genetically Modified Corn<br /> and just on principal because I can't afford to throw it away and did not want the hassle of returning it.<br /><br />I am very, very displeased with Amazon's incorrect listing of the product, which was brought to their attention when I purchased it in February 2012, and so far nothing has been done.<br /><br />*Although Calcium Sulfate is considered a safe food additive it is basically the same thing as Plaster of Paris. AND, if you use too much of this product (basically the same amount as I had previous used of pure CORN STARCH), the very stiff sediment in the bottom of the cooking container (I make pudding in Pyrex in a microwave and usually stir it only every 30 seconds) will remind you of damp plaster!",0,0

They tomatoes are certified San Marzano but not DOP like the item shows in picture. I called amazon and they sent me another box of 12 for free to fix issue. THe new shipment was still certified not DOP.  So please know this. Tomatoes are ok but not the best fyi.,0,0

While I like the flavor, I do NOT want decaff in the morning, which is when I drink coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am unable to return this item to Amazon because of their return policy, which is why I'm writing this review, to make sure others know the coffee packaging has changed and it is definitely labeled as decaffeinated now. I would give more stars for flavor, but the lack of official notification in the product description that this coffee is decaff makes me feel as if I tossed my money out the window, buying something I would not have otherwise ordered.",0,0

Sure, it was just sugar water with some flavoring, but it was really good flavoring...except it had a chemical whang and an aftertaste that you just had to accept.<br /><br />Well, no more.  Switch Orange Tangerine drink is NOT sugar water.  It's 100% juice, the good stuff, and it's lightly carbonated, not overcarbonated like those sugary soft drinks either.  And no chemical whang!  And no aftertaste!<br /><br />Vitamin C and no added sugar?  I'll take that.  Of course there's sugar content, but it's just the natural sugar that comes in the juice.  Why didn't people think of this stuff when I was a kid?",1,0

"What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.<br />I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.<br />I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable.<br />Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market.",0,0
"This product was a big disappointment.  The picture on the box is misleading.  These bars aren't chunky, the dough isn't flaky (more like cardboardy), they aren't filled with pieces of fruit, and if you didn't read the label (which claims about 30 items down the ingredient list that ""yogurt powder"" is added), you wouldn't have any idea you were eating yogurt at all.  The bars probably contain MSGs, with all of the ""natural flavorings,"" etc.  Whatever calcium and other vitamins might be present have probably been added in what the ingredients list calls a ""vitamin blend"" -- there's too little food in the bar to give you much nutrition, anyway.  The experience is very much like eating a long, thin fig bar -- only not as tasty.  The fig bars I buy at my neighborhood grocery contain sugar, but also real fruit, whole wheat, no MSGs, and no trans fats. I'd rather eat one of them. I won't be purchasing this product again.",0,0
"this was terrible coffee Wolfgang Pucks Jamaicamecrazy, I received a partial refund but felt I should have gotten a full refund as I can't drink the coffee and had to throw it all away. Also had to pay shipping and should not of had to. I would like a response to this.",0,0
"I have a One:One Coffee Pod machine and have ordered pods online before.  These looked good and sounded like high quality coffee- albeit a little pricey for 12 pods.  This was the worst cup of coffee I have ever tasted!  It left a bitter taste in my mouth that lingered for hours.  Yuck!  Don't be fooled by the fancy name and packaging. It tastes like rocket fuel.  Fortunately, Amazon refunded my money when I explained how bad it was. Throwing the whole box away!",0,0
"This coffee smells really bad - there is definitely no ""delicious"" smell as it brews or as you take sips from your mug.  It tastes just as awful too.  The first couple sips that I had, with my nose closed so I couldn't smell it, wasn't too bad but the more sips I took the more disgusting it was.  It is absolutely stomach turning (to me at least) and unfortunately I will never drink the whole bag. It tastes like a weak, poorly brewed, cheap cup of coffee (though not cheap!).  The only positive note is that it did not irritate my bladder - just irritated my nose and taste buds.",0,0
"Since I am willing to try alot of new things. I thought that I would buy this product.. And since I do like hot cocoa, I bought 2 boxes.. WORST thing I could have done.. This is bland, with very little flavour. It also has a grainy texture near the bottom of the mug.<br />Personally I will not buy this product again. I will stay with swiss miss or another hot cocoa brand for the Keurig K-Cup",0,0

"Well I have tried many protein shakes and the taste is never been a problem for me but this was just horrible. It's GOOD for YOU but I just couldn't do it.

"Ended up with a case of the Stephen's chocolate rasberry and a case of the Stephen's French Vanilla<br />""cocoa.""  I really wanted to believe the 100% positive feedback on here, but you should never believe<br />what you read, right?<br />I guess the 1st thing I look for in a cocoa is that the liquid has some body to it. This seemed just<br />watery and weak....it looks like a no-fat soymilk.<br /><br />It kind of makes me think of baby formula...........the other reviewer who said like a hot vanilla<br />milkshake is close to describing it but it is not creamy enough in my opinion to qualify as such.....<br /><br />I added MORE than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so-so.<br /><br />I am just not impressed with the way the powder globbed together and<br />clumped and stuck to the spoon~yuk.<br />$5 a can for 12 serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for 99 cents on sale for<br />the same amount of servings?<br />Granted, Amazon's price is better than the manufactures website since there is NO shipping through<br />here and shipping is at a premium through Stephen's Gourmet.<br />I would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first, do not bother wasting your money to buy<br />6lbs of cocoa mix at one time. You might end up doing what I will have to do when you don't like it.<br />sigh<br />give it away~",0,0
"This is not jerky, this is processed, hard like a rock, very greasy and stale smelling stripe of something that you can't break into anything smaller than 2 inches long and that certainly is not the size of a training treat! The dogs- 45lb dogs that will eat anything- were not impressed, it was hard to chew, and it sounded like they were crunching rocks, most of them spat it out after a few chews, left it there, this would be the first time they would not eat something in their entire lives, these dogs will work for lettuce.

"I have never tasted such a poor excuse for a cocoa drink. It has such a bad aftertaste that I checked the box to see if I ordered sugarfree by mistake! I will toss this  and chalk it up to a loss but if you are reading this, dont buy this brand. Its downright awful!",0,0
it tastes pretty decent but I wasn't aware how pricy they were when I bought them.  I paid $17.44 for a pack of 12!!!  What a rip off!,1,0
"If Keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular K-Cup, Keurig would be out of business. Wolfgang Puck - French Roast Melange Francais is inexcusably terrible coffee. Aroma hints of singed oak leave and the top note is simply bitter.  Mid taste is like the bottom ounces of a days old Kwiki-Mart carafe.  Mouth feel is harsh and leaves an appalling coating. The after taste leads one to immediately brush ones teeth.  I simply couldn't believe my Keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee, so I tried again a week later with same results. I use average-to-good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like Green Mountain, Tulleys, nor Emeril's. Everyone I know that has a Keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup. Usually the results are stunning, and the Keurig invasion lives on.  When I share I'll stick with offering The Coffee Peoples' Black Tiger or Jet Fuel. Now I have 22 more WP/FR K-cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of. Let me know if you want them, as I'd be embarrassed to even give them away.  Sorry Wolfgang, but what the Puck - your French Roast is unpardonably horrible, and at K-cup prices I'll not be duped again. I'll stay away from any of the other WP offerings.",0,0
This iced tea is terrible. This is the first Stash product that I do not enjoy. It is not iced tea. It tastes more like powdered peppermint leaves.,0,0

"Been gluten free for 7 years now. Thought we were done with mixes that tasted awful.  We threw it away because we did not like it. For my money, you can't beat Pamela's baking mix. But, the Betty Crocker chocolate chips are the BEST! So, don't give up Betty Crocker, just work on this one!",0,0
"As coffee in general, this Wolfgang variety was alright. However, I was expecting a ""Creme Caramel"" taste, or something similar, and I don't feel this delivered. I tried multiple cups at different cup sizes and this coffee just didn't do it for me. It is marketed as a flavored coffee, yet I could not taste anything beyond the flavor of coffee.",0,0
"I almost never write reviews, but I thought I would for this one.  I'm pretty open to tastes of anything, but something about the smell and taste of this product was really bad.  It tasted ""off"" almost.  I'm really disappointed because I had hoped to like it and I love fruity green teas, but this was NO GOOD.  I'd strongly recommend trying a sample of this (if possible) before buying.  Sorry Zhena's.... maybe I'll like another flavor.  I haven't given up on you yet.",0,0

"Thought I was ordering summer tea flavors, got leftover winter garbage. I will not buy from this seller again. I HATE iced coffee, much less gingerbread and eggnog flavors! I cannot believe I just spent that amount of money on crap that I will not ever drink. Should have waited until Walmart carried it! Does Keurig know this stuff is being sold under such false advertisements? Yes, I know it says flavors may be substituted. That would be fine if they were more teas. If I had wanted gross iced coffee flavors, I would have ordered such!<br /><br />On the up side, the peach tea I received was very good. Otherwise, don't waste your money!",0,0
"I read the reviews for this product and had high hopes for a healthy, decent tasting cup of noodles. Needless to say I found this not to be true.

"I bought two bags of these, thinking it was the same product that I used to buy in different packaging (light blue, with a see-through dog shape against a grass green background). Unfortunately, it was completely not the same thing! These treats were actually like jerky-- tough and brittle. I give my dog soft treats because he doesn't chew the damn things, and he choked on these horrible things; I had to toss them out.<br /><br />Note that the ""Zuke's Jerky Naturals"" with the other packaging (http://www.amazon.com/Zukes-Jerky-Naturals-Beef/dp/B00008DFPY) have always been moist and soft, and I've never had a problem with those. I suspect that this batch was not new packaging, as I had thought, but very old packaging; these may be the same treats I usually feed my dog, just having sat on a shelf for years. In any case, these were COMPLETELY different treats, and not safe to feed my dog.",0,0
